# Personal_Projects
A place for my personal projects made while learning new topics.

## Course Feedback Survey
Basic online form with user input using html and css.  This was made as part of freecodecamp's Responsive Web Design course.  I modified the end of course survey I used during my introductory computer science course.

## Zoidberg Bio
Very basic html and css page for Dr. Zoidberg from the show Futurama.  This was made as part of freecodecamp's Responsive Web Design course.
